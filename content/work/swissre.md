**Projects**

Helix (WebApp): Lead Angular Developer.  Originator of a web application (Angular + SVG + REST services) onto Swiss Re’s grid-based analytics system which replaces the previous delivery mechanism of Excel spreadsheets. The application provides an intuitive, user-friendly entry point to a highly complex and otherwise opaque analytics library with a rich graphical editor for the executable graphs. 

Trade booking Web Application: (Solo) Angular Developer.  Delivered a client application to use Helix.  The replacement trade booking system was required for Murex to Aladdin migration with tight deadlines.  This is the first of many intended applications to use Helix-as-a-service at both the GUI and REST server interfaces

SPIRE (Reserving Platform): Full Stack Angular/Java Developer.  First phase development of the large-scale replacement Reversing system for Actuaries.  

Worked in distributed team across Europe and US.
