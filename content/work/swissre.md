**Projects**

##### Graphical Editor for Analytics System : Helix WebApp

We devised and delivered a web application onto Swiss Reâ€™s grid-based analytics system which replaces the previous delivery mechanism of Excel spreadsheets.

The application provides an intuitive, user-friendly entry point to a highly complex and otherwise opaque analytics library with a rich graphical editor for the executable graphs.

##### Trade Booking WebApp

We delivered a client web application to use the Helix REST API. The replacement trade booking system was required for Swiss Re's trading system migration.

Working too tight deadlines, this is the first of many intended applications to use Helix "as a service" at both the GUI and REST server interfaces.

##### Cloud-based WorkFlow : SPIRE Reserving Platform

Built on top of Azure Logic Apps functionality, we designed and delivered a configurable workflow system to model the live cycle of a brand new Reversing system for Actuaries.
