**Projects**

##### Java Consultants

Skyler had existing clients using their Java applications in live settings, but the deployed binaries where getting old and no new features or bug fixes were possible due to lack of Java developer capacity.

We reviewed, documentated and refreshed all the legacy Java source code and created new build systems to build the code.

We revitalised the stalled evolution of the main Java applications and added many new features to the Java Swing GUI applications.

We introduced unit and integration tests.
