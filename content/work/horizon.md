**Projects**

Day-to-day responsibility to support trading desks in a pressurized and reactive manner.

Introduced REST/Web API delivery pattern to replace disparate, individual WinForms applications.

Introduced the KendoUI JavaScript widget library to provide standardised, rich web user interfaces

Delivered a successful migration of the price collection system from a manual and error-prone Excel solution to a robust REST client/server solution with various web admin pages to easily configure the price collection from Bloomberg across regional, instrument specific time-zones.  The switch-over was done by moving by instrument class and exchange in order to never interrupt the daily trading.

Delivered various REST applications for trading desks and middle office.
