**Projects**

##### New Web-based Delivery Pattern

We introduced a client/sever (Web/C# via REST) delivery pattern to replace disparate, individual WinForms applications. We then delivered various web-based REST applications for trading desks and middle office.

We introduced the KendoUI JavaScript widget library to provide standardised, rich web user interfaces

##### "Price Grab"

We successfully delivered a new implementation of the price collection system.

This replaced a manual and error-prone Excel solution with a robust REST client/server solution with a suite of web admin applications to easily configure the price collection from Bloomberg across regional, instrument specific time-zones.

The incremental live switch-over was done by moving by instrument class and region in order to never interrupt the daily trading.

##### Manual Prices

We delivered a web application for middle office to be able to set and fully document prices for illiquid products.
